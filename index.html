  Hong Kong (/ˈhɒŋkɒŋ/; Chinese: 香港, Cantonese: [hœ́ːŋ.kɔ̌ːŋ] (About this soundlisten)), officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (HKSAR),[d] is a metropolitan area and special administrative region of China on the eastern Pearl River Delta in South China. With over 7.5 million residents of various nationalities[e] in a 1,104-square-kilometre (426 sq mi) territory, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world.

  Hong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842.[16] The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898.[17][18] British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941 to 1945; British administration resumed after the surrender of Japan.[19] The whole territory was transferred to China in 1997.[20] As one of China's two special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of "one country, two systems".[21][f]
  
  Originally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages,[16] the territory has become one of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports.[22] It is the world's tenth-largest exporter and ninth-largest importer.[23][24] Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and its currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world.[25] Hong Kong is home to the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[26] the highest number of billionaires of any city in Asia, and the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world.[27][28] Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, severe income inequality exists among the population.[29]
  
  Hong Kong is a highly developed territory and ranks fourth on the UN Human Development Index.[30] The city has the largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the world,[31] and its residents have some of the highest life expectancies in the world.[30] The dense space led to a developed transportation network with public transport rates exceeding 90 percent.[32] Hong Kong is ranked 4th in the Global Financial Centres Index.[33]

  Delhi (English: /ˈdɛli/; Hindi: [ˈdɪlːiː] Dillī; Punjabi: [ˈdɪlːiː] Dillī; Urdu: [ˈdɛɦliː] Dêhlī),[15] officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.[16][17] It is bordered by the state of Haryana on three sides and by Uttar Pradesh to the east. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6] the second-highest in India after Mumbai,[18] while the whole NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7] Delhi's urban area is now considered to extend beyond the NCT boundaries, and include the neighbouring satellite cities of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area called the National Capital Region (NCR) and had an estimated 2016 population of over 26 million people, making it the world's second-largest urban area according to the United Nations.[8] Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Delhi either the most or second-most productive metro area of India.[11][19] Delhi is the second-wealthiest city in India after Mumbai and is home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires.[20] Delhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index.[13] Delhi has the second-highest GDP per capita in India.[10] Delhi is of great historical significance as an important commercial, transport, and cultural hub, as well as the political centre of India.[21]

Delhi is one of the oldest cities in the world, and has been continuously inhabited since the 6th century BCE.[22] Through most of its history, Delhi has served as a capital of various kingdoms and empires, most notably the Tomars, Chahamanas, Delhi Sultanate and Mughals. It is also assumed to be the location of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata. The city has been captured, ransacked and rebuilt several times, particularly during the medieval period, and modern Delhi is a cluster of a number of cities spread across the metropolitan region. For many centuries Delhi has been a dominant trading and commercial centre in northern India, and since the 1990s it has emerged as an important node in the international corporate and financial network.[23]

A union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, 1982 Asian Games, 1983 NAM Summit, 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, 2010 Commonwealth Games, 2012 BRICS Summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region (NCR), which is a unique 'interstate regional planning' area created by the National Capital Region Planning Board Act of 1985.[24][25]
